<section class="about">
    <p>There are approximately 37 species of foxes, living across every continent expect Antarctica; however the most common of these species, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has about 47 recognized subspecies alone. 12 of these species belong to the monophyletic "true fox" group of genus Vulpes; the remaining 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes. These foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group or of the outlying group. Popular in culture and folklore, foxes are know for their cunning nature.

But as an opportunist and an omnivore, insects or meat from rodents and birds are eaten when available.</p>

It's large ears play a role in thermoregulation in the semi-arid regions it resides in. Bat-eared foxes are considered the only truly insectivorous canid, with a marked preference for harvester termites which can constitute 80-90% of its diet.</p>

        <p>The Gray fox is one of three belonging to the genus <em>Urocyon</em>. Once the most common fox in the Eastern United States, human advancement and deforestation allowed the  red fox to become the predominant fox-like canid. It is the only canid whose natural range spans both North and South America.  In regions where gray foxes and coyotes hunt for the same food, the gray fox has been observed to give space to the coyote, staying within its own established range for hunting.</p>

However, at the time of his visit the animal was already very rare on East Falkland, and even on West Falkland its numbers were declining rapidly. Around 1880, the animal had become extinct.</p>

        <p>The fennec fox is a small crepuscular fox native to the deserts of North Africa, ranging from Western Sahara and Mauritania to the Sinai Peninsula. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate heat and listen for underground prey. The fennec is the smallest fox species. Omnivorous, it feeds on small rodents, lizards, small birds and their eggs, insects, fruits, leaves, roots and also some tubers. It relies on the moisture content of prey, but drinks water when available.</p>

The Tibetan fox primarily preys on plateau pikas, followed by rodents, marmots, woolly hares, rabbits, small ground birds and lizards. Tibetan foxes may form commensal relationships with brown bears during hunts for pikas. The bears dig out the pikas, and the foxes grab them when they escape the bears.</p>
